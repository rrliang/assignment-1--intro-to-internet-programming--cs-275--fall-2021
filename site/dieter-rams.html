	<p class="p2" style="text-indent: 40px">Born in Germany in 1932, Dieter Rams made his way up into the industrial design field. He approached designing with the fresh outlook of "less but better". In the 1970s, Rams introduced his "Good Design" principles to the world. <a href="index.html">The "Good Design" Principles</a> has culminated into design elements seen all over the world. Even now, companies are being influenced by Ram's unique outlook on the sustainability in design. For example, Apple designer Jonathan Ive based the Apple iOS 6 calculator using the principles laid out by Rams. Often regarded as one of the most influential designers alive, credited for the simple yet rousing designs seen in Braun coffeemakers, shavers, stereos, calculators, and many other products. Rams has also worked with the well-known furniture company Vitsœ. There, he implemented his revolutionary designs to create simple yet alluring furniture. Rams works with Vitsœ to this day.</p> 
	<p class="p2" style="text-indent: 40px">Dieter Rams ideals not only produce good-looking things, they also question the stability of design and address the very real nature of diminishing resources. Not only should consumers have the luxury of a product that is designed to last, the product itself should be environmentally friendly. A prominent quote from his ten principles, "Back to purity, back to simplicity" is a line that is sure to strike a chord with most people. Although Ram's design tactics have been successful within the past decades, the products coming out of industries in the United States can also be found in exreme excess. Not only are these products flashy in nature just to be so, they go against almost all of the principles of good design. Things like gaudy sports cars or jewlery are not made to last, nor are they made with the simplest design in mind. The overly-thought out designs of these products points to how simplicity can be taken for grannted.</p>
	<p class="p2" style="text-indent: 40px">Although initially made for physical products that one would expect from manufacturers to consumers, Ram's version of design is so universal that it can be interpreted to more abstract things like that of web design. Any designer, no matter what profession, can learn a bit and improve upon themselves by following the footsteps of Dieter Rams. Coding a webpage is no different. The website designer must know the correct way to attract traffic to the website, and this can be done by following Ram's ten principles to a T. Not only should the website look good, it must have a useful, honest and impactful purpose. Obtaining these three qualities to a website will certainly increase the longevity and popularity of the website. Although it may be hard to think about what the environmental aspect of the ten princples ties in with computer scientists, the concept is relatively easy to tie together with the amount of power/electricity needed to power the website. Bright colors and an absense of neutral colors may strain the eyes of the person reading the contents of the website, and it also take extra power to turn on pixels that are not black.</p>
