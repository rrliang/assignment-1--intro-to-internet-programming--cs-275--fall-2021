    <p>1. Good design is innovative. The possibilities for progression are not, by any means,
    exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities
    for original designs. But imaginative design always develops in tandem with
    improving technology, and can never be an end in itself.</p>
    <p>2. Good design makes a product useful. A product is bought to be used.
    It has to satisfy not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic
    criteria. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst
    disregarding anything that could detract from it. </p>
  <p>3. Good design is aesthetic. The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to
    its usefulness because products are used every day and have an effect on people
    and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be beautiful. </p>
  <p>4. Good design makes a product understandable. It clarifies the product’s
    structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its
    function by making use of the user’s intuition. At best, it is
    self-explanatory.</p>
  <p>5. Good design is unobtrusive. Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools.
    They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should
    therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s
    self-expression.</p>
  <p>6. Good design is honest. It does not make a product appear more innovative,
    powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate
    the consumer with promises that cannot be kept. </p>
  <p>7. Good design is long-lasting. It avoids being fashionable and therefore
    never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years — 
    even in today’s throwaway society. </p>
  <p>8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail. Nothing must be arbitrary
     or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect
     towards the consumer. </p>
  <p>9. Good design is environmentally friendly. Design makes an important
    contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources
    and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the
    product.</p>
  <p>10. Good design is as little design as possible. Less, but better — because it
     concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened
     with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity. </p>
