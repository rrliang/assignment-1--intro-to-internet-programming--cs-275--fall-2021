  <nav class= "nav" >
    <ul>
  <li><a href="#"> Innovative</a></li>
  <p class="para">
      The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for original designs.
    <br> But imaginative design always develops in tandem with improving technology, and can never be an end in itself.</br>
  </p>
  <li><a href="#">Product useful</a></li>
  <p >
     A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic criteria.
     <br> Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could detract from it.<br>
  </p>
<li><a href="#">Aesthetic</a></li>
<p class="para">
  The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products are used every day and have an effect on people and their well-being.
  <br>Only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</br>
</p>
  <li><a href="#"> Product understandable</a></li>
  <p class="para">
     It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its function by making use of the user’s intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.
  </p>
<li> <a href="#"> Unobtrusive</a></li>
<p class="para">
  Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art.
  <br> Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.</br>
</p>
  <li><a href="#"> Honest</a></li>
  <p class="para">
     It does not make a product appear more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.
  </p>
  <li><a href="#"> Long-lasting</a></li>
  <p class="para">
     It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years — even in today’s throwaway society.
  </p>
  <li><a href="#"> Detail</a></li>
  <p class="para">
    Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.
  </p>
  <li><a href="#">  Environmentally friendly</a></li>
  <p class="para">
    Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment.
    <br> It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</br>
  </p>
  <li><a href="#"> Desgin</a></li>
  <p class="para">
    Less, but better — because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.
